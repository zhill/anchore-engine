"""
Interface for the vulnerabilities subsystem.

This component of the engine is hydrated by data from feeds or a local source.

The evaluation and model side of the system are specific to the data, so this is a layer on top of the
general feeds implementation as it consumes the feed data. Other components should interact with this layer.

Generally, this code has a lot of comments to help explain things since it can be somewhat subtle as to why things
work the way they do and often the behavior is a result of the range of cleanliness of the data itself.
